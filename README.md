###### Objective :
***To make a chatbot that could help a customer who comes to a hotel, to give his order or receive the bill without waiting for any person to take it so that it doesn't create any inconvenience.***

###### Task of the bot :
***Our chatbot greets the customer who comes to a hotel and asks for his/her name. According to the time it displays a different menu at different parts of the day. It takes the input from the user in the form of "ID OF RECIPE - Quantity" and stores it. After mentioning all the items he wish to have it displays the bill so that he could see his order and a link (Rough text for now) through which he can pay the bill. After the money transfer he could receive a message that the food will be served soon. At last, it asks for the feedback.***
